Rope Data Structure

    Is a type of binary tree composed of small strings that is used 
to efficiently store and manipulatea very long string. Each node can
have 2 children, parent node holds the total sum of the weights of the leaf
nodes in its left subtree and every leaf node holds a string.

Implemented functions

    1.Concatenation - Join 2 ropes(s1 and s2) by adding another knot that
will become the root and its weight becomes the sum of weights of leaf
nodes in S1.

    2.Index - Find the character at ith position

    3.Search - Find the characters between 2 positions

    4.Split - Divide the rope into 2 on position i and there are 2 cases:
                * Split point being the last character of a leaf node
                * Split point being a middle character of a leaf node.
    
    5.Insertion - Add a string at position i by splitting the rope at this
position followed by 2 concatenations

    6.Deletion - Delete a string from an interval by 2 splits of the rope
followed by a concatenation
